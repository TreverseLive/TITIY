TITIY: Tap-It That Insults You!

Hi! Thank you for downloading TITIY: the Tap-It That Insults You!

This project was written and designed by me, Treverse! 
(This program was inspired by Hasbro's game, Bop-It. Original idea as well as form layout credits
should be forwarded their way. In addition, small snippets of code have been inspired by similar
code found on StackOverflow.)
