Hi! Thank you for downloading TITIY: the Tap-It That Insults You!

This project was written and designed by me, Treverse! 
(This program was inspired by Hasbro's game, Bop-It. Original idea as well as form layout credits
should be forwarded their way. In addition, small snippets of code have been inspired by similar
code found on StackOverflow, and sound effects are found from Pixabay.com.)

----------------------------------------------CHANGELOG----------------------------------------------
[2.2.0] - 06-15-23
	- Full public release!
	- Added a start page.
	- Added a credits page.
	- Cleaned up naming schemes.
	- Cleaned up small bugs.
	- Added a written link to the bug report form in case the hyperlink fails.

	KNOWN BUGS:
	- Entire game freezes while a voice line is being played. This is due to the fact that
	  the program is put to sleep while playing a voice line, to avoid overwriting anything
	  as well as to prevent the timer from running during a voice line.
	- Norton Security hates this game with a burning passion and will remove it from your PC
	  at the earliest convenience. This unfortunately isn't something I can fix.

[2.1.1] - 01-27-23
	- Color-coded buttons on the Sound Effect Editor screen to avoid confusion.
	- Changed all button-press sound effects to avoid potential copyright issues.
	- Added a success chime sound effect upon choosing the correct button.
	- Added a fail buzzer sound effect upon choosing the wrong button.
	- Fixed issue where Twist It voice line occasionally would not play.
	- Recentered buttons that were not previously centered.

[2.1.0] - 01-19-2023
	- We've reached over 1,000 lines of code!
	- Fixed issue where some game voice lines would not dynamically change the speed of the game
	  after leaving the Change Sound screen.
	- Raised the resting time limit by .1 seconds.
	- Added a "Reset Line" button for resetting a single voice line, rather than being forced
	  to reset ALL lines.

[2.0.2] - 12-18-2022
	- Fixed bug where no sound would play if the player's custom file could not be found.
	- Fixed bug where the wrong sound file would occasionally be overwritten.
	- Fixed issue where Twist-It Voice Line could not be changed.

[2.0.0] - 12-18-2022
	- Reformatted the general size and position of game elements.
	- Added a completely new page to the game that allows players to import their own local 
	  sound files quickly, easily, and efficiently, to overwrite preexisting default sounds. 
	  Only .wav files are accepted at this moment.
		- Added support for these sound files by making the game automatically dynamically 
		  adjust itself to the duration of the files, adding support for any and all 
		  .wav files.
	- Adjusted waiting durations of default files, making them much more accurate and fair.

[1.0.1] - 11-28-22
	- Removed the ability to resize the window, which skewed the game perspective.
	- Lowered the resting time limit and made time decrease faster.
